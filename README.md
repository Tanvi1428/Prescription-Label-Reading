# Prescription-Label-Reading
This project leverages Paddle OCR, a comprehensive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool, to facilitate the accurate reading of prescription labels. Prescription labels often contain crucial information such as medication names, dosages, instructions, and patient details, which are vital for patient safety and adherence to prescribed treatments. However, the variability in label formats, fonts, and handwritten notes poses a significant challenge for automated text recognition.
Paddle OCR, an open-source OCR framework developed by PaddlePaddle, is employed in this project due to its robustness, ease of use, and support for multiple languages and scripts.The project's success is measured by its ability to accurately capture and present critical information from diverse prescription label formats, thereby reducing medication errors and improving patient compliance.
This project highlights the potential of OCR technology in healthcare applications, aiming to enhance patient safety through improved medication management.
